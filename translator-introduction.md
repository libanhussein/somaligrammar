## 📖 Af Soomaali

Anoo yar dugsi qur'aanka dhiganaayo halkaan (Maraykanka), waxaan xasuustaa wiil iila dhigan jiray oo qosol iyo kaftan badnaa Ibraahim la yiraahdo. Casharkiisa markuu ka baxay, waa loo fasaxay inuu gurigiisa tago.

Hooyadiisa markeey timid dugsigii, wiilkii wuxuu yiri, “Macalin, ma baxi karaa? Hooyadeey dibada u taalaa.” 

Markaan maqlay, waan yaabay, waayo, qofna kama saxin af Soomaaligiisa qaldanaa. Waxa laga rabay inuu dheho, “Macalin, ma baxi karaa? Hooyadeey banaankeey joogtaa, ama banaankeey igu sugeeysaa.” 

Maalintaas waxaa igu soo dhacay, “amaad adiga laftigaaga ku hadashay af Soomaali qaldan sidii saaxiibkaaga Ibraahim?” Maalintaas kaddib, waxaan asxaabteeyda iyo waalidkeeyga ka codsaday, haddii aad maqashiin anoo af Soomaali qalad ah ku hadlaayo, igu qosol markii hore, kaddib na iga sax. 

Sidaas daraadeed, waxaan helay buug laguu daabacay Xamar 1973-gii oo la yiraahdo “Aasaaska Naxwaha Af Soomaaliga.” InshaAllah, waxaan ku dadaali doonaa tarjumadiisa af Ingriiska inaan soo saaro. Waxaan rajeynayaa tarjumadaasi ineey anfacdo markii hore aniga, kaddib na qof kasta Ingriis yaqaan oo jecel naxwaha af Soomaali inuu barto. 


## 📖 English
Growing up, I had a childhood friend named Ibrahim who I’d see during our weekend school (madrasa/dugsi). He was really bright and had a great sense of humor too.

One day, after he passed his lesson, he was given permission to go home. Long story short, when he finished his lesson and saw his mom parked outside, he asked for permission to leave (in Somali) but did so in an interesting way. Instead of saying “my mom is outside,” he said something along the lines of “my mom is located outside,” using the word typically used for inanimate objects. 

I was surprised that no one corrected what sounded like an obvious grammatical mistake. But I felt even worse knowing that I too had made grammatical mistakes when speaking that were often left unnoticed and struggled to piece words and sentences together. 

It might not have seemed like the craziest thing at the time, but in hindsight, it felt like such a common thing in the States to either speak the Somali language inaccurately or not speak at all, leading to what seems like an identity crisis for many. They aren’t able to fully engage with their immigrant parents or the larger community when speaking, and this certainly has its consequences long term. 

In this regard, I asked my more fluent friends as well as parents to correct me if they found that I was speaking incorrectly and to assist me in learning and developing a stronger vocabulary. Shortly after, I found a book published in Mogadishu by the Somali Language Committee in 1973 known as “The Foundations for Somali Grammar.” My hope is that this translation benefits myself primarily, and every English-speaking Somali who has an interest in learning the grammatical structure of our beautiful mother tongue.
